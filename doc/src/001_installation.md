Installation {#installation}
===============

We don't yet provide binaries for MARS, thus installing it requires downloading the source and building it locally. To simplify this task, we have created a set of install scripts that will do all the work of downloading and installing dependencies, cloning the MARS repository and building for you. They have their own repository on GitHub: [PyBob for MARS installation](https://github.com/rock-simulation/pybob)
