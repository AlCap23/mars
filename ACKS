MARS was mainly developed by the German Research Center for Artificial
Intelligence (DFKI) but over time several people have contributed to its
development.  This file serves as a place to acknowledge the
contributions of those people.
The order of the list is arbitrary and does not reflect the importance
or value of people's contributions in any way.
