2014/08/14 MARStools discontinued in this repository

As of today, the MARStools python scripts have been separated from the MARS repository and moved to a new github repository. The Blender addon is now called "Phobos" and can be found at: https://github.com/rock-simulation/phobos

To avoid re-writing history in the MARS repository, the commits related to Phobos so far will stay in this repository, but will not be further updated. The folder will be deleted once the migration is completex and it is verified that all went without problems.

If you have any questions, please refer to the maintainer of Phobos, Kai von Szadkowski: kai.von-szadkowski@uni-bremen.de
